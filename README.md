PHS Play/Musical Arduino Sketch for Controlling Clock

This Arduino sketch uses the Arduino Motor Controller 

Just drives a single motor

Designed to ramp the speed up and put safeties in place to prevent the damage to the clock gear box 
by changing direction on the fly.

Analog Input 3 (Motor Shield Input 1)  = Forward Direction

Analog Input 4 (Motor Shield Input 2) = Reverse Direction

Relay Configuration for Input Ports

Common = Signal Port
N/C = Ground
